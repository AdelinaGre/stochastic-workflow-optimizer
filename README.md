# stochastic-workflow-optimizer
This project implements a robust Stochastic Queueing Simulation to solve operational inefficiencies in automated service workflows. Utilizing Python (SimPy) and Markov Chain theory, the model creates a Digital Twin of a multi-stage service center (e.g., Car Wash or EV Charging Station).
